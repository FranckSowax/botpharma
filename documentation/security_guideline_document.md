# Implementation Plan for WhatsApp Conversational Assistant

Below is a step-by-step roadmap—organized into epics and sprints—with security best practices woven in at every layer. Adjust timelines and priorities based on team velocity and business needs.

---

## 1. Discovery & High-Level Design (1 week)

### Goals
- Validate requirements, use cases, and data flows.  
- Define non-functional requirements (scalability, availability, security, compliance).  
- Produce architecture diagrams and ERD for Supabase schema.

### Deliverables
- Functional and non-functional requirements spec.  
- High-level System Architecture & Sequence Diagrams.  
- Data Model (Products, Customers, Conversations, Consent logs).

### Security Focus
- Threat modeling (identify trust boundaries, data flows).  
- Define roles/permissions (RBAC matrix).  
- Decide on secrets management (e.g., Supabase environment vars + Vault).

---

## 2. Infrastructure & Foundation (Sprint 1, 2 weeks)

### Tasks
- Provision Supabase project (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage).  
- Configure CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI).  
- Establish secure environments (dev, staging, prod) with TLS enforcement.  
- Integrate secret management (store API keys, JWT secrets, Whapi credentials).  
- Enable vulnerability scanning (SCA) in CI.

### Security Controls
- Enforce HTTPS (HSTS) for all endpoints.  
- Apply least-privilege to DB roles.  
- Harden Supabase settings (disable public anon inserts).  
- Set up logging & monitoring (error and access logs).

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization (Sprint 2, 1.5 weeks)

### Tasks
- Implement Supabase Auth for dashboard (email/password + optional MFA).  
- Enforce strong password policy (bcrypt/Argon2, unique salt).  
- Design JWT flows for API, enforce `exp`, algorithm validation.  
- Implement RBAC middleware in Next.js API routes and backend services.

### Security Controls
- Secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).  
- Protect against session fixation, brute-force (rate limit login).  
- CSRF protection on dashboard (anti-CSRF tokens).

---

## 4. Core Backend APIs & Data Layer (Sprint 3, 2 weeks)

### Tasks
- Define REST/GraphQL endpoints for:  
  • Product CRUD (with CSV import/export)  
  • Customer record updates (behavioral data, consent)  
  • Conversation logging  
- Implement server-side validation & sanitization (Zod or similar).  
- Secure file uploads: validate file type/size, store in Supabase Storage outside webroot.

### Security Controls
- Use parameterized queries / ORM (Supabase client) to prevent SQL injection.  
- Validate all inputs server-side.  
- Return generic error messages; log detailed errors internally.

---

## 5. WhatsApp Integration & Consent Flow (Sprint 4, 2 weeks)

### Tasks
- Integrate Whapi API for inbound/outbound messaging.  
- Build webhook endpoint for message callbacks (validate HMAC signature).  
- Implement RGPD consent flow:  
  • On first message, send consent prompt.  
  • Store consent status & timestamp.  
  • Handle “SUPPRIMER” keyword to flag deletion requests.
- Basic message router for:  
  • Welcome + quick replies  
  • Keyword detection (advisor handoff triggers)

### Security Controls
- Validate incoming webhooks (IP allow-list, signature).  
- Rate limit public endpoints to mitigate DoS.  
- Log consent events in an audit-safe table.

---

## 6. AI-Powered Recommendation Engine (Sprint 5, 2 weeks)

### Tasks
- Integrate GPT-4o via OpenAI SDK (secure API key management).  
- Develop prompt templates for product recommendations and health advice.  
- Implement fallback logic & caching (in case of model latency/errors).  
- Safely parse AI responses; sanitize before sending to user.

### Security Controls
- Enforce timeouts on external API calls.  
- Validate and sanitize AI output to prevent prompt injections.  
- Monitor usage & cost; implement throttling if needed.

---

## 7. Admin Dashboard Implementation (Sprint 6, 2.5 weeks)

### Tech & Tasks
- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn UI.  
- Implement login/logout flows with Supabase Auth.  
- Role-based UI: conditionally render Admin, Editor, Support views.  
- Product management: forms with client- & server-side validation.  
- Conversation feed: real-time update via Supabase Realtime or polling.  
- Reporting pages: charts (e.g., Recharts), KPIs.

### Security Controls
- Apply security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options).  
- Protect API routes with middleware (JWT + roles).  
- Use SRI for any third-party assets.

---

## 8. Reporting, Alerts & Loyalty Campaigns (Sprint 7, 1.5 weeks)

### Tasks
- Build endpoints to aggregate KPIs: conversations count, conversion rate, sales, satisfaction.  
- Dashboard widgets for loyalty-message stats & coupon distribution.  
- Email alert service (SendGrid/Mailgun) for human-advisor escalation.  
- Scheduled jobs (cron) for loyalty campaigns, post-purchase follow-ups.

### Security Controls
- Validate cron-job inputs and sanitize.  
- Secure email templates to prevent header injection.  
- Monitor job failures; alert on anomalies.

---

## 9. Testing & Security Hardening (Sprint 8, 2 weeks)

### Tasks
- Write unit tests (Jest) and integration tests (Supertest or Playwright).  
- Perform end-to-end tests on core flows (WhatsApp → API → Dashboard).  
- Conduct security reviews:  
  • SAST (e.g., ESLint security plugins)  
  • Dependency vulnerability scan (npm audit / SCA)  
  • Penetration testing checklist (OWASP Top 10).  
- Fix findings, tighten input validation, error handling.

### Security Controls
- Ensure no secrets in repos.  
- Verify TLS configuration and certificate expiry.  
- Lock down CORS to dashboard origin only.

---

## 10. Deployment & Monitoring (Sprint 9, 1.5 weeks)

### Tasks
- Deploy to production (Vercel for Next.js, Supabase prod).  
- Configure environment-specific variables securely.  
- Set up monitoring & alerting (Datadog/Prometheus, Sentry).  
- Document runbooks for incident response.
- Launch internal security audit and compliance review.

### Security Controls
- Disable debug/log levels in prod.  
- Enforce auto-rotating secrets where possible.  
- Review backups & disaster-recovery plan.

---

## 11. Post-Launch & Continuous Improvement

- Gather feedback, iterate on conversational UX.  
- Add multi-language support if needed.  
- Plan for performance scaling (horizontal sharding, Supabase Edge Functions).  
- Regularly update dependencies and re-run security scans.  
- Monitor GDPR compliance and data-subject requests.

---

### Next Steps
1. Review this plan with stakeholders and adjust scope/timeline.  
2. Finalize sprint durations and team assignments.  
3. Kick off Sprint 0 (Discovery & Setup).
