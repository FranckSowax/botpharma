# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

We are building a WhatsApp conversational assistant (‚ÄúL√©a‚Äù) for a parapharmacy in Libreville, Gabon. L√©a will welcome customers automatically, ask targeted questions to understand their needs, recommend suitable products, and guide them through order placement. After purchase, L√©a will follow up with satisfaction surveys, usage tips, and loyalty offers. All interactions happen over WhatsApp Business, while product and customer data live in Supabase. The WhatsApp API (Whapi) handles message exchange, and GPT-4o may power natural-language understanding and personalized recommendations.

This assistant aims to streamline the customer journey: from discovery and advice to conversion and retention. Key success criteria include high user engagement on WhatsApp, accurate product recommendations, smooth handoff to human advisors when needed, and measurable improvements in conversion and repeat purchases. A web-based dashboard will let administrators import or edit products, monitor conversations, view KPIs (conversations, conversions, sales, satisfaction), and manage RGPD consent.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (Version 1)

*   WhatsApp conversational flow in French
*   Automatic greeting, RGPD consent capture, targeted Q&A menus
*   Product recommendation with images, price, availability
*   Redirection to human advisor (triggered by keywords or high cart value)
*   Delivery of links to external e-commerce cart for order placement
*   Post-purchase follow-up messages (satisfaction survey, usage tips)
*   Automated loyalty messages/coupons
*   Supabase backend:\
    ‚Ä¢ Products table (import via CSV or form)\
    ‚Ä¢ Customers table enriched by AI (profile, history, satisfaction)\
    ‚Ä¢ Consent and deletion logs
*   Web dashboard (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI):\
    ‚Ä¢ Role-based access (Admin, Product Editor, Support)\
    ‚Ä¢ Product management (CRUD, CSV import)\
    ‚Ä¢ Conversation and KPI reporting (conversations, conversion rate, sales, satisfaction)\
    ‚Ä¢ RGPD compliance module
*   Integration with Whapi API for sending/receiving WhatsApp messages

### Out-of-Scope (Phase 2 or Later)

*   Multilingual support (English, others)
*   Direct payment processing inside WhatsApp
*   Advanced analytics modules (predictive sales forecasting)
*   In-depth satisfaction sentiment analysis beyond basic ratings
*   Offline messaging or SMS fallback
*   Mobile-native admin app

## 3. User Flow

A customer sends any message to the parapharmacy‚Äôs WhatsApp number. L√©a replies immediately with a branded welcome message and asks for consent to process data (RGPD). Once consent is recorded, L√©a displays quick-reply buttons:

1.  ‚Äúüß¥ I‚Äôm looking for a product‚Äù
2.  ‚Äúüíä I need health advice‚Äù
3.  ‚ÄúüéÅ Show me promotions‚Äù

After selection, L√©a asks 2‚Äì3 targeted questions (e.g., product category, brand preference, bio/vegan). Responses update the customer‚Äôs profile in Supabase. L√©a uses GPT-4o (optional) to refine understanding and generate a shortlist of products. Each recommended item is sent with image, price, availability, and a ‚ÄúView in cart‚Äù link.

If the customer requests a human advisor (keywords like ‚Äútalk to advisor‚Äù) or their implied cart value exceeds 150 000 FCFA, an alert is sent by email and shown in the dashboard. Otherwise, the customer clicks the link to finalize their order on the external e-commerce site (card/PayPal). Once payment is confirmed, the backend records the sale and L√©a sends an order confirmation with tracking info.

Two days after delivery, L√©a initiates a satisfaction survey. The customer rates the experience and can ask follow-up questions. Based on their profile and purchase history, L√©a periodically sends personalized coupons or cross-sell offers to drive loyalty.
